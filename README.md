# Machine Learning for Clinical Predictive Analytics

We would like to introduce basic machine learning techniques and toolkits for clinical knowledge discovery in the workshop.
The material will cover common useful algorithms for clinical prediction tasks, as well as the diagnostic workflow of applying machine learning to real-world problems. 
We will use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) / python jupyter notebook and two datasets:

- Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, and 
- pre-extracted ICU data from PhysioNet Database
  
to build predictive models.

The learning objectives of this workshop tutorial are:

- Learn how to use Google colab / jupyter notebook
- Learn how to build machine learning models for clinical classification and/or clustering tasks

To accelerate the progress without obstacles, we hope that the readers fulfill the following prerequisites:

- [Skillset] basic python syntax
- [Requirements] Google account OR [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)

In part 1, we will go through the basic of machine learning for classification problems.
In part 2, we will investigate more on unsupervised learning methods for clustering and visualization.
In part 3, we will play with neural networks.
